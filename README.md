# EudaimonAI

> *"Happiness depends upon ourselves."* — Aristotle

**EudaimonAI** is an advanced life-management system designed to guide you toward **Eudaimonia**—a state of flourishing and well-being. Powered by the "System AI," this application gamifies your personal growth across the **8 Dimensions of Wellness**, turning the chaos of daily life into a structured, meaningful pursuit.

## 🧠 The Philosophy

EudaimonAI is built upon the framework of the **8 Dimensions of Wellness** (developed by Dr. Peggy Swarbrick). The System AI analyzes your activities and helps you maintain balance, ensuring you don't max out one stat while neglecting others.

### The 8 Dimensions
1.  **🧠 Intellectual:** Expanding knowledge and skills.
2.  **💪 Physical:** Health, nutrition, and sleep.
3.  **💰 Financial:** Resource management and security.
4.  **🏡 Environmental:** Harmony with your surroundings.
5.  **🛠 Vocational:** Satisfaction and enrichment in work.
6.  **🤝 Social:** Connection and community.
7.  **🎨 Emotional:** Coping effectively with life.
8.  **✨ Spiritual:** Purpose and meaning.

## 🎮 System Mechanics

The System AI interacts with you through a gamified interface:

*   **Quests:** Actionable tasks categorized by dimension.
*   **Achievements:** Milestones reached through consistent effort.
*   **Physical Integration:** Generate printable cards for your achievements to store in your physical "Loot Box," bridging the digital and physical realms.
*   **The System AI:** An omnipresent guide that tracks your progress and offers "encouragement."

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLite, SQLAlchemy
*   **AI:** OpenAI Integration

## 🚀 Initialization

To boot up the System and begin your pursuit:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eudaimonai.git
    cd eudaimonai
    ```

2.  **Start the System:**
    The `start.sh` script handles everything—setting up the Python virtual environment, installing dependencies (using `uv`), and launching both the frontend and backend.
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

3.  **Access the Interface:**
    *   **Frontend:** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
    *   **Backend API:** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## ⚠️ Warning

The System AI is watching. Neglect your dimensions at your own peril.
